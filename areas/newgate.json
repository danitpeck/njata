Huge hanging tapestries,\neach intricately detailed in vibrant colors, cover the featureless walls\nof your octagonal surroundings.

Gazing about your surroundings, your eye is drawn upward by\na much larger round tapestry hanging directly overhead, and you struggle\nwith your balance as you examine the fabric's images.  The growing sense\nof wonder which pulls at you is tinged with a dose of trepidation.  The\nviews about you, while wondrous, are nevertheless quite ominous; these\nimages are of a truly darkened land.",
