There's a very nice\nlooking leather chair here in front of a huge fireplace, with a good blaze\ngoing. On the mantle you see a fine assortment of pipes, and a couple jars\nof high quality pipeweed.\nOn the floor you spot a full bear-skin rug in front of the fireplace, and you\nsuddenly get the urge to make yourself comfortable in front of the fire with\na mug of hot coffee, fill a pipe up with some pipeweed, relax and listen to\ntales of days long past.",
