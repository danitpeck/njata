No items,\n  mobs or rooms in the area should be futuristic or even close to modern\n  day.\nMAZES --- The creation of mazes is encouraged, for it gives the player a\n  mental challenge. However, the area council will not carefully go through\n  it. It is up to the creator to pass through every room and make sure it\n  works properly.\nAREA APPROVAL --- When your area is completed, go through it a couple times\n  to make sure everything is as you want it.

The description should invoke a mental image of\n  the room. Builders should try to avoid describing player actions and\n  emotions in a description, as well as the presence and actions of a\n  mobile in the room (use mobprograms for those).\nSECTORS --- All room sectors must be filled out. Note that the inside\n  sector signifies that there is a roof over the player's head, while\n  the city sector means there is none. All rooms with the inside sector\n  must be accompanied by the indoors flag.\nFLAGS --- Room flags should be carefully thought out so you understand\n  how the players will get to and fight in certain room, as well as how\n  difficult it will be for them to retrieve their corpse.\nEXDESCS --- Exit descriptions should be filled in, especially ones that\n  lead in/out of building and other places of import. An exdesc for a DT\n  is absolutely necessary.\nROOM PROGS --- Feel free to use room programs if needed. These can be used\n  to confuse players or add mood.
