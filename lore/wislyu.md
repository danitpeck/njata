INFO ABOUT THE COLISTANI HUMANS, since Wislyu’s capital, ALKLYU is predominantly human:  
   
Colistani – the Colistani tend to be particularly tall for humans, ranging from 5’ 10” to 7’ 0”. Skin color is usually on the fairer side of the spectrum, though many southern Colistani are as dark-skinned as Lavandai. The skin tone tends towards pinker colorations in this continent. Hair color is wildly varied, though naturally Colistani tend to have darker hair colors.    
   
COLISTA: The prevailing method of identifying nobility among Colistani is as follows:  
   
Silzar (Highest rank, equivalent to Emperor)  
Kralje (equivalent to a monarch)  
Veiliki (highest rank to non-monarch landed nobility. Often related to the Kralje.)  
Volilni (children of the Kralje in line to receive the rank when they come of age and their parents either step down or pass away.)  
Vojvoda (Equivalent to a duke)  
Markiz (Marquis)  
Kont (Count)  
Vikont (Viscount)  
Baron (Baron)  
Vitez (Knight)  
   
Colistani:  
The Colistani worship a series of animal spirits. Each spirit is associated with a place that that animal commonly lives in. Some important ones:  
   
The FOX spirit: Associated with thickets and plainsland. Often portrayed as a gold and red furred fox, unlike the actual creatures. This spirit is credited with the presence or absence of game, and generally called ‘the hunter’.  
   
The OWL spirit: worshipped in the forest and mountains, treetops, etc.. Some say it is a permutation of the FIREBIRDS’ *Simurgh*. It is treated as a figure of great caution, and associated heavily with historical Scholars and institutions of learning. Called ‘the teacher’.  
   
The DEER spirit: heralded as the figure of innocence, worshipped in clearings and by ponds. Sometimes represented as a white hart, sometimes represented as brown faun. Stags are not generally the preferred artist’s rendition. Called ‘the pure’.  
   
The STRIPED SNAKE spirit: Worshipped everywhere, portrayed in all places. Always represented with vertical stripes, not stripes across its back. This is because the snake is considered to be the guide to the underworld in this religion, and must be able to transport people on its back. If the stripes were horizontal it would imply cutting the snake’s back and trying to kill it. This is notably not a poisonous snake, and it is frequently drawn subtly into artistic representations, sometimes disguised as a bangle on a priest’s wrist, only its tongue belying its true nature. Called ‘the outsider.’

| City 1 (CAPITOL) – Human Dominant – Alklyu |
| :---- |
| Location: At the base of the northern Phoenix mountain range. |
| Connects to: Samda, Etelae, Mantenda, Paiste, Fyr (and to Joutua, to the north) |
| Contains the following: |
| SHOPS |
| WEAPONS & ARMOR – There are three competing weapons shops here.   *Deirdre* sells only light-weight weapons, but also makes armor with her three apprentices, *Madison, Selma* and *Renee.* She delights in fencing and wants to encourage people to employ lighter blades for faster fighting capacity. She comes on a little strong.   *Mavol* makes all kinds of weapons, but doesn’t sell any armor. He works alone, or at least—he HAS worked alone since he lost his wife to a skirmish. She served in the city guard and so he highly respects the guard, even though it cost him his love.   *Sul* and *Tam* make heavier weapons and armor, and market their wares as being of foreign origin since they both migrated to Colista from Lavada. They are both blond and deeply tanned, and wear lots of jewelry. Sul is a mother of three children, though of course the kids don’t run around the store; Tam is apparently not the father, but Sul doesn’t like to talk about it. Tam may look tough enough to take on all comers, but he seems gentle of heart and clearly moved with Sul out of respect or maybe love for her.   FOOD & DRINK – Numerous places offer food and drink throughout the capitol. There are some small stands that sell the local delicacies, including *shyr*\-drenched goodies (very popular among the locals).   Bakery – there is a bakery run by two families that sells all manner of breads, as well as some sweets.   Butcher – Sells both raw and prepared meats, and officially serves the Kralje for big events.   Grocery – Sells food and drink of all kinds with a heavy emphasis on produce brought in from out of city limits by local farmers, etc.   Lacatur – A restaurant and inn; signature dish is rice and lamb with tomatoes, called ‘*chib e lam*’. They also specifically serve *shyr-*desserts.   \*Note: *shyr* is refined from the sap of trees in winter. Similar to syrup, it has more of a honey taste and keeps very well. It is thick and sticky and goes very well on breads, fruits, and nuts. \*   INNS – Aside from Lacatur, there are two other smaller inns, each with rooms to let.   Mainstay – the Mainstay is a sea-faring travel themed place, run by an older woman named *Felrin* who used to travel the Merroc river before settling in Alklyu. She is heavyset and has a no-nonsense attitude. Many stories to tell; perhaps even quests to give.   Whitewall—the Whitewall inn is not particularly special, save for a particular man who has taken residence in it. *Vikont Treman* lives here, and may have information for any travelers who come his way.   MAIL & STABLES –messages must be conveyed by horse or other mount, so the system in the realm is to send messages by courier a-horseback. Since many persons would prefer to deliver their messages personally and, since there is a profit to be had in caring for or loaning out horses, the mail and stables are one and the same. One can approach the mailroom to send a message or to ask for stabling for their mount or, if they haven’t got one, to ask for a mount to either ride to a specific location (like a ferry) or buy for personal use.   SCHOOL   There is an academia here; it has a library full of useful information, and several persons working within it who might be useful to players. Trainers (or whatever we end up picking) who know some class specific skills, perhaps? Also plot related:   *Vojvoda Zsa*, a beautiful woman descended of the same line as the previous Kralje, Adam. She takes care of and funds the library with her personal wealth. Austere and somewhat terrifying, she has a strength of character that makes most people feel she is unapproachable. Some people whisper that she plans to try to bring down Willam, but whether this is true or not is up to a lot of debate. \[In truth, she is very loyal to Willam because she manages his information network, and was one of the first to know, and confirm, his change in rank from soldier to Kralje. She knows much of the ins and outs of local politics, and keeps a watchful eye on Oesditan and Joutua, both of which have been making moves to try to infringe upon Wislyu’s lands for access to the Merroc river in recent years.\]   CITY GUARD STATION   If players wish to join the city guard, interact with the city guard, try to reconcile with the city guard etc. this is the place to go. There will likely be quests affiliated with this. The guard should be hiring on from time to time, as well as asking for outside help for special events (like the kralje having a huge ball or something). |
| IMPORTANT PEOPLE |
| *Kralje Willam* – the ruling monarch of the country. He was once a commoner, but was raised to this rank by the grace of his uncle, who cleverly put him into training with the previous Kralje, Adam, early in life. They became fast friends and fought many battles together. Willam became a hero to the people—an extension of themselves—and was known very well as Adam’s most trusted advisor. When Willam was struck down in a particularly grim battle, Adam fought to the death to protect him and proclaimed with his dying breath that, since he had no heirs, Willam should succeed him. Willam never fully recovered from his wound and has a nasty limp, but he tries his damnedest to make Adam proud.   |
| PLACES OF IMPORT   TOWN SQUARE – lots of events occur here. It is big enough for many booths to be set up, for dancing to take place during a revelry, or for the city guard to assemble fully if there is trouble.   WISHING WELL – there is a wishing well in the north quarter of town. It is haunted by a spirit that takes the face of whomever the person it is speaking to fears. Rumor has it that if you can best your fear and still make your wish, it is sure to come true.   |
|   Basic construction: The inner city is surrounded by a wall, a common architectural design in all human cities, especially capitols. The Kralje and his retinue live within a modest castle at the base of the mountains. Important buildings are made of stone, but many smaller ones are made of wood with thatched roofs.   |
