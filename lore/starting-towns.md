Starting Towns in Wislyu

 

Wislyu is predominantly a human nation. It is located in southern Colista, bordered on the east by the vast MERROC river, the north by mountains, the south by the ocean and the west by the country known as Aszaar. Despite its human populace, many races thrive in Wislyu.

 

Immak  \- a primarily dwarven port town. It is rumored that throwing coins into the cove of the naiad queen will bring good luck. (located on the southern tip of the country. Port, and two roads leading to it; one is a road that quickly leads to the eastern bridge over the MERROC, the other to Aviatrix and Sedna

 

Aviatrix \- a fairy town in the forest treetops. One has to be TINY to fit in here\! Aviatrix is famous locally for their skyraces, a sport that generates a great deal of interest among fairies and non-fairies alike.

 

Sedna \- a human town more or less beneath Aviatrix. It is a busy town, though mostly only because of mercantile traffic. The town is built around a small, pristine pond that, under the light of a certain kind of moon, is rumored to light on blue and terrible fire. The villagers perform rituals of protection when this phase of the moon is on its way.

 

 

That's all I dare risk throwing out without actually planning ahead first, or we'll start getting haphazard\!

Ok, on the character creation: I would like to see the races color coded by whether they are carnivores (orange or brown), herbivores (green), or omnivores (yellow or dark yellow?). I'd like to color code the classes too, but I'm not sure by what system. Magic/Nonmagic?

Anyway. More details on the other two starting towns.

Aviatrix \- a tiny fairy treat\! Important note: Light is provided by tiny lanterns set along the "walkways" created in the treetops, and spread out over the city in a net made of something like spider's silk. The net is brought out over the city by members of the Fairy Guard at night. It provides enough illumination to travel safely through the open streets at night. The morning shift of the guard are tasked with putting the net away. It's probably bioluminescent matter or something that collects energy like glow in the dark stuff during the day and glows through the night.

THE FAIRY TOWN HAS:

\- SHOPS AND STUFF-

Shopping plaza on top of the yellow-leaf tree. This tree is always yellow all year and like evergreens its leaves don't fall off in winter. The shopping plaza is an open area with three to five shopping stands in it. (like a bazaar). Two of these stands sell varieties of food and drink, the third handles bets on skyraces if any are going on. The fourth and fifth, if they're set up at the time(?), sell flying tours for visitors to Aviatrix and flight jackets, respectively, since it can get cold if one goes on the tours. I'm thinking the last two are only open during good weather and the daytime. The others might be open in bad weather, maybe even at night.

Mapseller \- These maps magically resize to be the correct size for the person using them at any given time. The mapseller knows the way to Sedna (of course), Immak, and to whatever the nearest CITY is, and has extremely accurate maps leading there. (This is in place of roads to these places.) When one has a map, one can check it and it will tell you the direction you need to go to get closer to your destination safely. (ie, query map \-\> "south" if you're still south of Sedna.) DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS POSSIBLE but I think it could be cool and worth working on if it's not currently doable.

Fortune Teller \- Sells magic items, tells fortunes (joke code) and sells racing capes for the Skyraces when they're going on.

Tiny magic weaponmaster\! \- sells weapons that can only be used when you are TINY\! also sells lightweight tiny armor.

\*SKYRACES\*

These are held monthly? weekly? Whatever-- Fairies riding on a sparrows fly through an obstacle course. Skyraces must take place at night for safety reasons, and are quite spectacular because they involve a lot of fancy bioluminescent obstacles. Betting can be done on the participants at the bookie's stand; PCs can enter if they are tiny, and if they have a flying mount, for a fee-- if they win they receive double the fee, and a medal I guess?. Not sure if this can be represented in the MUD though\! I'd want to have multiple potential courses, etc., and I don't know if ACTUALLY watching them would be any fun for other players. But well. It's all in development.

Sedna \- a human town more or less beneath Aviatrix. It is a busy town, though mostly only because of mercantile traffic. The town is built around a small, pristine pond that, under the light of a certain kind of moon, is rumored to light on blue and terrible fire. The villagers perform rituals of protection when this phase of the moon is on its way.

\-SHOPS AND STUFF-

The Bear's Paw- A huge tavern that sells food as well\! It has a huge common room that can house thirty folk. The wood it is constructed of is painted seasonally, and the wait staff are all skilled at arm wrestling. Maybe you can arm wrestle them for fun? Anyway, the waitresses are cute and buff, the waiters are scruffy woodsy guys. It's the tone of the place\! All species are welcome as long as they don't start trouble. Bear's Paw also sells protective charms of the local gods for the superstitious.

Carpenter- the carpenter makes excellent weapons and knows enough about leatherworking to make leather armor, but doesn't work with metal, really. Sells both the weapons and armor.

Bronze artisan- this guy can smelt bronze and all, and makes necessities with it. He doesn't generally do anything violent with this skill however. He has made only one weapon out of bronze, and it was cast into the pond.

The Pond \- This extremely clear pond is safe to drink from and swim in, and is regarded with a mix of fear and relief. It is a wellspring of freshwater, on which the villagers rely. However, on certain nights, when the moon is in a certain phase, it is lit with an eerie fire that seems to come from beneath the pond, and a frightening spirit or creature surfaces to eat anyone not protected by the gods within the village. (Questline I imagine, with a dungeon beneath the pond. Probably follow the Beowulf idea as I was excitedly explaining last night\!)

The Courier- This guy will take messages anywhere. He knows just enough magery to fit places it might be hard to fit, and has a mount just trustworthy and clever enough to get him there. I don't know that this should be anything but aesthetic, but I like the idea of some towns having a mail service. Maybe it's a human thing\!

I feel like I ought to add more to Sedna but this is a good start and covers the basics, I think.

Hopefully two towns will keep you busy for a little while\! ;)
