North

mpecho Looking uneasily through the northern window,
mpecho the vision before you seems filled with doubt.
mpecho "I wouldn't recommend trying to go to the north.
mpecho It is a cold and uncharted place, and I hear
mpecho that not many return from their attempts to
mpecho travel it. Maybe in the future, it will
mpecho become safer."
mpecho
mpecho It shakes its head. "I cannot be certain."

Lavada

mpecho Seeming to waver along its surfaces, the vision says,
mpecho "Lavada is the largest continent in all of Njata.
mpecho Almost all of it is arid desert. This landscape
mpecho varies between sand dunes and moutain-ringed valleys
mpecho but is almost always monstrously hot. It would
mpecho not be suitable for people who do not like dry places,
mpecho except possibly at the northern tips of this land.
mpecho There, large cities and port towns thrive on trade
mpecho of their native tropical, exotic goods to the
mpecho northern continents."

Colista

mpecho The vision shifts and says, "Colista is the most
mpecho populous region of the world. Many think
mpecho that it is the oldest bed of civilization.
mpecho People of all races travel there, though there
mpecho are some few not native to the area."
mpecho
mpecho Looking to the West, it goes on. "Colista
mpecho is a diverse region, with several big rivers,
mpecho two inland seas and four lakes, many mountain
mpecho regions and long stretches of forest.
mpecho There is some plainsland in this continent
mpecho but it is scarce, and the rockier ground makes
mpecho for less sandy beaches in most areas."

Dori

mpecho Reflective vision says, "Dori is a very temperate
mpecho place, though it has many countries in it, and
mpecho almost as many peoples. It is warmer than Colista,
mpecho but cooler than Lavada, located primarily on the
mpecho equator and comprised mainly of plains.
mpecho
mpecho Turning its face to the eastern window, the vision
mpecho continues. "You will find that there are no
mpecho Benn, Slimes, Dragons, Gryphons, Firebirds,
mpecho Satyrs, Dwarves or Sphinxes native to
mpecho this region. However, humans, elves
mpecho and half-elves hold many of the countries
mpecho here."
