    "content": "1) Use in character channels like Say and Whisper for in\n   character communication, and out of character channels\n   like Tell, Ask, Answer and Chat for out of character\n   conversations. When in doubt, ask an Immortal!\n\n2) You are responsible for anything your character does.\n   The excuse \"But someone else was playing my character\"\n   is not an acceptable one.\n\n3) No botting whatsoever. In addition to violating any\n   of our attempts here at immersion, this also leads to\n   griefing other people who are actually -playing- their\n   character.\n\n4) Multiplying is allowed, but only so long as your\n   characters aren't PVP flagged. Exceptions will be made\n   for multiple players playing on the same LAN, of course.\n\n5) Don't advertise other muds or post offensive links in\n   public areas. If you're unsure about what's offensive,\n   don't post it!\n\n6) Please don't harass others. We have a zero tolerance\n   policy for griefers, and will come down hard on anyone\n   doing it to others."
